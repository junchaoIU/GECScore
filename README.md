This repository is the official implementation of GECScore, a simple but effective black-box zero-shot detection approach, predicated on the observation that human-written texts typically contain more grammatical errors than LLM-generated texts.

## 🧐 Overview

The efficacy of detectors for texts generated by large language models (LLMs) substantially depends on the availability of large-scale training data. However, white-box zero-shot detectors, which require no such data, are limited by the accessibility of the source model of the LLM-generated text. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective black-box zero-shot detection approach based on the observation that, from the perspective of LLMs, human-written texts typically contain more grammatical errors than LLM-generated texts. This approach involves calculating the Grammar Error Correction Score (GECScore) for the given text to differentiate between human-written and LLM-generated text. Experimental results show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) zero-shot and supervised methods, achieving an average AUROC of 98.62\% across XSum and Writing Prompts dataset. Additionally, our approach demonstrates strong reliability in the wild, exhibiting robust generalization and resistance to paraphrasing attacks.

## ⚙️ Data and Experimental Reproduction

### Data

- Raw Data
- Normal Data
- Paraphrae Data
- Perturb Data

### Detector Usage

- detection based on the threshold pre-defined
```bash
# zero-shot-detection in xsum.GPT-4o setting
python detector.py --test_data_path xsum.GPT-4o.normal.test_data.json --threshold True --threshold_value 0.9243697428995128
```
  

- detection based on the threshold trained on the training data
```bash
# zero-shot-detection in xsum.GPT-4o setting
python detector.py --train_data_path xsum.GPT-4o.normal.test_data.json --test_data_path xsum.GPT-4o.normal.test_data.json 

# generalization in from xsum.GPT-4o to writing.GPT-4o setting
python detector.py --train_data_path xsum.GPT-4o.normal.test_data.json --test_data_path writing.GPT-4o.normal.test_data.json
```
